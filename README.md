# Forking this repository to create a personalized page for a school
Doorstop Education

1. Fork the repo.
2. Add the github to netlify and add your chosen custom domain or subdomain (eg. whs.doorstopped.org) to all custom domains (eg. whs.doorstopeducation.org).
3. Upload a logo to /assets/images/ and name it doors.svg, optionally adding a white version named doors-white.svg.
4. For all "form" Doorstops, add the specific contact point for your school.
5. Create another site on plausible, along with a new API key, adding the .env key locally and in Netlify
6. Choose which Doorstop categories you would like to use and create any school-specific ones (see below)
7. Change /index to some other content, or make the main landing page the student-facing one currently at /student.
8. Share your subdomain (or custom domain!) link with students. Go to /analytics on the live site to see how students are interacting with Doorstops!
9. Sync changes from the main fork often, as that is where new Doorstops will be added!

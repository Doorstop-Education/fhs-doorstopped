            <h1><strong>You have a food problem. We’ll give you $200 to help solve it.</strong></h1>


            <p>
            If people are skipping school lunch and not eating at all, it doesn’t matter if the food is free. <strong>The school is failing to feed students.</strong> That is the most basic need.
            </p>
            <p>
            What’s the root cause of kids not eating at your school? Pick a problem, we’ll take you to a tested strategy. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The food is so <strong><a style="scroll-margin-top: 4.5em;" href="#starve">GROSS</a> </strong>people would rather starve.
            </p>
            <p>
            Buying lunch is <strong><a style="scroll-margin-top: 4.5em;" href="#stigma">STIGMATIZED</a></strong>, people don’t eat it because they’re SHUNNED.
            </p>
            <p>
            The food is too <strong><a style="scroll-margin-top: 4.5em;" href="#pricey">PRICEY</a></strong>, there are kids begging for morsels next to the lunch line.
            </p>
            <p>
            There’s not <strong><a style="scroll-margin-top: 4.5em;" href="#enough">ENOUGH</a></strong>, people skip breakfast and dinner.
            </p>
            <p>
            Nobody has <strong><a style="scroll-margin-top: 4.5em;" href="#time">TIME</a> </strong>to eat, the line is too long or people take an extra class during lunch.
            </p>
            <p>
            Or… jump right to a strategy you think will work: 
            </p>
            <ul>
            
            <li><a style="scroll-margin-top: 4.5em;" href="#data">Collect data. Bring it to administrators</a>—evidence that kids aren’t eating will make them change lunch.

            <ul>
             
            <li>Collect quick data
             
            <li>Get our grant

            <h2 id="data">NEGOTIATING WITH TRUST AND DATA</h2>
            
            
            <p>
            Collect data. Bring it to administrators—evidence that kids aren’t eating will make them change lunch. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Count how many kids don't eat during lunch block. Get a percentage. 
            </p>
            <p>
            If someone goes out to eat or gets food from home, they ate. If lunch is not the issue, poll 20 students on whether they had breakfast. 
            </p>
            <p>
            We’re doing the same nationwide: send us a percentage, we’ll get national news. Email <a href="mailto:guzovsky@princeton.edu">guzovsky@princeton.edu</a> with your school name, state, and percentage of students who eat something during lunch.
            </p>
            <p>
            Bring that information to administrators. Walk up to your principal or their secretary and ask for a meeting. Say:
            </p>
            <p>
            “Students aren’t eating anything during lunch: I surveyed students and X% didn’t eat because [your reason, eg. the frozen food is too gross]. Food is a basic need, and you have a responsibility to make sure students don’t go hungry. Can you rework the budget to [your solution, eg. serve food more students will eat]?
            </p>

            <a style="scroll-margin-top: 4.5em;" href="#cook">CHOOSE WHAT TO COOK</a>.

            <h2 id="starve">People would rather STARVE: </h2>
            
            
            <p>
            To get federal funding for meals (which a lot of under-resourced high schools want), they have to serve really, really gross food: federal requirements are strictly anti-seasoning and happiness.<sup id="fnref1"><a style="scroll-margin-top: 4.5em;" href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Your school only has $1.19 per meal to spend.<sup id="fnref2"><a style="scroll-margin-top: 4.5em;" href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> So… ok. What now? You’re going to have to <a style="scroll-margin-top: 4.5em;" href="#cook">cook for yourself and your friends</a>.
            </p>
            <h2 id="stigma">Buying lunch is STIGMATIZED</h2>
            
            
            <p>
            Fixing this takes someone getting punched in the face. Or, if that’s not your thing. Try <a href="http://doorstopped.org/doorstops/ref">SCHOOLWIDE CULTURE SHIFT</a>. Don’t want to commit to a big project, just take a simpler approach:
            </p>
            <p>
            SAY THAT THERE’S STIGMA. LOUDLY. Put up posters, wear a disguise while you tape them to the walls if you have to. Here’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C099Bnu_si6dM1Iap-jHpVbCOhqaahV7X31CjJ8d1EQ/copy?usp=sharing">a template poster that actually works</a>. This is like saying to your little cousin that bites people, “Hey, you’re hurting me.” And they’re like, “Oh, I am?”

            <p>
            This is a problem for your PRINCIPAL (or honestly, you’re probably a private schooler if you’re in this section, so “Head of Upper School”), and I’m sure a JOURNALIST would love an anonymous tip that kids aren’t EATING. We call that LEVERAGE, BESTIE.
            </p>
            <p>
            Don’t actually expose your school to the news like that unless there is no other option. It’ll have long term negative consequences because every administrator will start acting paranoid. Try this first.
            </p>

    <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Support [High school name] students who don't eat during lunch?<br><br>
Hello [name],<br>
    <br>
We’re all students at [Your High School Name], and many of us take an additional class during our lunch period, meaning we eat nothing during the school day. We do this out of pressure to achieve at the highest level, but we won’t anymore.<br>
    <br>
Lunch is important to us. It’s a basic need for health. When you see our applications in the coming years and notice students are taking one less class, that’s why. Please consider us as continuing to take the most challenging course load available at our school, as a course load that denies us food denies our basic needs.<br>    
<br>
Thank you for reading.<br><br>
Regards,<br>
[Your High School Name] Students.

            <h2 id="cook">COOOOOOK</h2>
            
            
            <p>
            <strong>Level 1: The Muffin Man</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            Buy chips and snacks. Bring them in your backpack. Distribute them sneakily. This is your beta test to see just how hungry people are.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Level 2: The Snack Shack</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            Get a waffle maker, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DASH-DMW001AQ-Individual-Chaffles-Non-Stick/dp/B01M9I779L/">start small</a>. You can plug this baby in anywhere and throw some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Krusteaz-Belgian-Waffle-Mix-Foodservice/dp/B004AJIG76">waffle mix</a> in. Use a classroom, or any room near the cafeteria. Buy some snacks, too. Set up an operation. Charge a dollar a waffle if you want to turn this into a business, or do it for free if you’re all about supporting the community (we’ll spot you). If people like it, you can start thinking bigger… 
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Level 3: Enchiladas in Bulk</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            If you don’t have a kitchen at home for this, ask a local restaurant or food pantry to use their kitchen. If they’re worried about liability insurance, we can cover you. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Make something easy to do in bulk. Pasta with meat sauce. Ground beef and tortillas. Egg and cheese sandwiches. Don’t forget about vegetables. And SALT.
            </p>
            <p>
            Bringing in friends to help: 10 people means you only have to cook once every two weeks. 
            </p>
            <p>
            You’ll need:
            </p>
            <ul>
            
            <li>A table. Your school has lots of tables: clutch up, secure the bag.
            
            <li>If you want to keep things warm, set up near an outlet or find an oil-powered mini-stove.
            
            <li>A sign. Nothing’s real unless you have a sign. Get it from the art classroom or CVS.
            
            <li>Survey Data. Understand #1 how many students you feed and #2 how many students don’t eat during lunch. Poll 20 random classmates in the halls. Record it for proof if you’re feeling elite. When an administrator comes to shut down your operation, <strong>your data is your leverage:</strong> “We felt it was necessary to bend school rules and sell food because students are not eating during lunch: we polled students and X% skip lunch. Food is a basic need, and we’re happy to work with any health regulations you need us to, but we will not shut down.
            </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
            
            <li>Vlog walking into school (either solo or w/ a parent of a student for legitimacy) and giving out free food
            
            <li>Cold email your favorite youtube chefs for recipe ideas. 
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            <strong>Level 4: The Legitimate Operation</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            SAY IT’S FOR A FUNDRAISER for…
            </p>
            <ul>
            
            <li>a local food pantry (partner with them, you can borrow their kitchen to cook meals)
            
            <li>For giving kids who can’t afford it meals outside of school (so you run your service once during lunch, once after school, paid for by the kids!)
            
            <li>For any cause you want, as long as the fundraiser runs … first weekly, then daily!
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            <strong>Level 5: Permission from the School, Subsidies for kids who can’t afford it.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            GET A FOOD TRUCK (already may have navigated certain regulations - which I, to write this page, will need to understand & explain)(richland had it)
            </p>
            <p>
            MAKE SURE YOUR FOOD IS UP TO CODE REGARDLESS: HERE’S HOW TO COOK WITH HIGH STANDARDS. 
            </p>
            <ul>
            
            <li>Wash your hands.
            
            <li>Make sure your meat is cooked through.
            
            <li>Don’t let raw stuff touch other stuff.
            </li>
            </ul>

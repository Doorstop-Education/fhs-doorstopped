    <p style="color: grey; text-align: center;">If you think the punishment is even A LITTLE unfair, you have a (nonviolent) way to fight back.</p>
</div>
<p>So, imagine you&apos;re in school and your teacher punishes you every time you do something they don&apos;t like. It&apos;s like they don&apos;t even see you&apos;re trying to stand up for yourself because something isn&apos;t fair. This kind of punishment doesn&apos;t consider your feelings or why you acted out&mdash;and it IGNORES that you want to do better, that you&rsquo;re a good person, and that you have value. Plus, it grows the gap between the AP or &ldquo;gifted&rdquo; kids, who have it easier, and you getting pushed back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Think about a doctor who only treats a stomach ache and ignores why you&apos;re sick in the first place (maybe you&rsquo;re lactose intolerant).&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is what we call the&nbsp;medical model. Some people use this model to treat low income folks. They don&apos;t try to fix the unfair system; instead, they keep doing things that make life even harder.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Play some defense. If you get in trouble, here&rsquo;s what you can say to minimize or remove the punishment:</p>

<strong>For racial discrimination:</strong>
<div class="copy-paste-element">
    <div>
        <p>From kindergarten, black kids are punished harsher than white kids for the same offenses. This racial disparity continues through high school: minority students are more likely to be disciplined for the same offenses and face larger punishments.&nbsp;
            <br><br>
Could you reconsider the length and severity of my punishment? I admit that I was in the wrong. Please admit that you see me as a &ldquo;problem child,&rdquo; not a &ldquo;child with problems.&rdquo; From there, we can start collaborating to change your perspective on me and make school safer for me and my peers, not kick me out.</p>

<strong>For non-violent violations:</strong>
<div class="copy-paste-element">
    <div>
        <p>There is a causal link between students who are suspended for minor offenses and their grades going down in the following years.&nbsp;In 2013, 43% of suspensions were for insubordination. I understand punishment, but please work with me to find another way to punish me that doesn&rsquo;t permanently leave me with anxiety and distrust for school.<br><br>Plus, according to education researchers published in the Harvard Education Review, &ldquo;under unjust conditions schools forfeit their ability to hold students accountable for role-dependent violations.&rdquo; By role-dependent, they mean any rule imposed by the school&mdash;so punish me if I physically hurt someone, but excessively punishing me for ____ is not legitimate.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>For insulting a teacher:</strong>

        <p>School is a place where students and teachers have to show up like yesterday didn&rsquo;t happen. If either of us are offended, we just have to keep on covering material: there&rsquo;s no space for conversation or forgiveness. <br><br>
I take responsibility for what I said, but excessive punishment only perpetuates the unequal social situations that hurt me and my teacher. I am willing to work around this, or if needed, to change my schedule, but <em>I will not be treated like a second class citizen without you at least acknowledging the contribution this school environment had to my outburst,</em> because placing all the blame on me with a punishment to match turns me into a second class citizen.

An Ohio fifth grader was suspended from for three days because he pointed his finger &quot;in the shape of a gun&quot; and pulled an imaginary trigger while playing with his friends; the letter from the principal to the parents cited his finger as a &quot;level 2 lookalike firearm.&quot; Source: Bush, B. (2014). Boy points finger like gun, gets suspended. Columbus Dispatch, March 23, 2014.</p>
<p>W/o specific example: Schools had zero-tolerance policies on dress code and non-violent offenses less than 10 years ago. Did our school? In 2013, 43% percent of expulsions and out-of-school suspensions a week more were for&nbsp;insubordination. Seriously? These types of suspensions are proven to contribute to the school-to-prison pipeline. Source: Robers et al., 2013, p. 167, Table 19.3.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>For violent violations:</strong>
<p>In rural Montana, at a school we visited. A student said something really, really awful about the teacher's wife. To his face.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We like to pretend everything can be solved non-violently. But that's not always true. The teacher pinned the kid to the wall by the throat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The kid went to the principal's office. He knew he fucked up. The teacher wasn't punished.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The system isn't always that reasonable. But sometimes you have to punch people. We don't have any profound advice for this.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The American Bar Association recommends that: Disciplinary guidelines must establish that a child should only be separated from school if lower levels of graduated interventions, including all in-school interventions have failed, the student is unresponsive to targeted interventions in consultation with appropriate personnel including a psychologist or a licensed counselor and it has been determined that failing to remove the student would pose a threat of safety to the student or to others.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Key takeaways:</strong>
<ul class="badonk">
    <li class="honk">
        <p>SHOW SELF AWARENESS.&nbsp;Admit that what you did was wrong while making it clear there were also societal influences that you couldn&rsquo;t control.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="honk">
        <p>OFFER A MIDDLE GROUND.&nbsp;Ask for the punishment to be reduced, don&rsquo;t just call it out.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="honk">
        <p>USE DATA TO PROVE YOUR POINT.&nbsp;That way, you&rsquo;ll prove that you&rsquo;re not just some angry kid.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>

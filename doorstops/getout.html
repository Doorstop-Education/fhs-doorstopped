                  <p>Reqs: Strong relationship with your teacher&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Skills: Emotional availability, Proactive communication</p>
                  <p>Remember when you were in fourth grade and your crazy friend Jamarison would staple himself just to get out of class?</p>
                  <p>Well, you can&rsquo;t get away with that anymore, but you still can go to the nurse.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Going to the nurse can always be a once-a-semester escape plan, but if you want to go regularly, your teacher must know you&rsquo;re regularly stressed and tired. Have you ever seen a teacher walk up to a student with their head in their desk and ask, &ldquo;Do you want to go to the nurse?&rdquo;</p>
                  <p>Problems:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>&ldquo;The nurse at my school is an asshole&rdquo; Link to [how to build a good relationship with the nurse w/ Deer Park examples]</li>
                  </ul>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Men who are afraid to admit pain, it&rsquo;s okay to go to the nurse. [link]</li>

                  <h2>The 10 minute walk&hellip; 20 minute walk&hellip; 2 hour walk&hellip;</h2>
                  <p>Reqs:</p>
                  <p>Skills:&nbsp; Pitching yourself, Comfort under stress</p>
                  <p>To take a walk during class often, your teacher must know why: they don&rsquo;t need your whole emotional history and every trauma you&rsquo;ve been through, but they need <strong>visual or verbal cues that you&rsquo;re stressed, tired, in your feelings, or out of it</strong>.</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li><strong>Stressed, Tired, Out of it: </strong>Head on your desk. Listening to music. Silence. Blank stares. No movement.</li>
                  <li><strong>In your feelings:</strong> Rowdy, but a little frustrated. [Say more, but think PA]</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>How long a walk can you get away with?</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>ADMINISTRATORS/TEACHERS YOU DON&rsquo;T KNOW WELL: They like a 5 minute walk, can negotiate to 10.</li>
                  <li>TEACHERS YOU ARE CLOSE WITH: 10-15 minutes.</li>
                  <li>BESTIE TEACHERS: As long as you want.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The teacher cannot have <em>everybody leaving class</em> becoming normal. It undermines their authority and, honestly, makes them feel pretty awful about themselves. Keep this in mind when you think about how long your walk should be. You might do this naturally: <strong>If you&rsquo;re often stressed, tired, in your feelings, or out of it, match the length of your walk to the intensity of your feelings.&nbsp;</strong></p>
                  <p style="text-align: center;">[Diagram]</p>
                  <p>If you don&rsquo;t have an emotion or some personal reasons for leaving class, always leave for the same amount of time [link to habits as motivation].&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>If your teacher is hostile to your walks <em>beyond</em> what you think is fair (it&rsquo;s true, people should generally be in class or the class won&rsquo;t function&mdash;and a dysfunctional class can get your teacher fired) see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W-zo0vMAWIB2PRT0qWA9cA9-9P6o_2nZAnZ5qR0oXsw/edit#heading=h.gkfgdiarg2mx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salami Tactics</a> further down.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Going to the bathroom is all about networking. &ldquo;NETWORKING&rdquo; is a term that&rsquo;s thrown around a lot. It means getting to know people who are willing to help you.&nbsp;</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>If the lunch lady gives you an extra scoop because you smile at her, that&rsquo;s networking.</li>

                  <p>You need to know all the people you might run into on the way to the bathroom, and how they&rsquo;ll handle the situation:</p>

                  <li><strong>Tardiness Culture</strong>: ECHS, Not a big deal, but you need to be able to handle these small levels of stress.</li>
                  <li><strong>Strict culture</strong>: New Visions, you need to carry around a massive bathroom pass, staff will get very if you don&rsquo;t have one.</li>

                  <p>The <strong>best</strong> way to handle a phone call is telling your teacher in advance that you&rsquo;ll have to take one. You don&rsquo;t have to specify: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s personal&rdquo; is enough. [Link to &ldquo;why proactively communicate&rdquo;]</p>

                  <p>Reqs: A very large class or a very inattentive teacher</p>
                  <p>Skills: Subversion, Comfort under stress</p>
                  <p>If you told your teacher to their face, &ldquo;I get up and walk out of your class, then don&rsquo;t come back for a while. I respect you and what you do, but [school name] as it&rsquo;s set up isn&rsquo;t working for me.&rdquo; What would they say?&mdash;Can you handle that confrontation?</p>
                  <p>Fuck. I was in classes where kids walked out, drove 20 minutes to Dunkin Donuts (both ways), then came back WITH a latte and nobody said shit.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Those kids will never have a confrontation. The teacher doesn&rsquo;t have time.</p>
                  <p>But make sure if you try this, that you&rsquo;re ready for that confrontation, because if it happens, it&rsquo;ll hurt your reputation.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Reputation matters, not for how other people see you, but for your health. When you feel like you don&rsquo;t belong, or that others don&rsquo;t trust you, it hurts. You start to care even less and say &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo; more.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>[audio form] &ldquo;When I used to cut class and leave the building, I saw that teachers that seen me leaving didn&rsquo;t say a thing to me. They didn&rsquo;t care because it was one less troublemaker in school, one less stupid Black boy to teach, and one less kid in their class. All of this made their lives easier. You know what used to be funny? These teachers would tell you that if you study hard you could be this or could be that, but they knew that this would not happen to most of us. They lied right to my face and you could tell that they was never honest&hellip; My old school was a terrible place to go to.

                  <h2>The PUZZLE SET</h2>
                  <p>Reqs: Space in the back of the classroom and your favorite board game, chairs that you can get up from quietly</p>
                  <p>Skills: immaculate vibes</p>
                  <p>Rural Utah, school is TWO HALLWAYS.</p>
                  <p>I&rsquo;m in a Science class, 10 people.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>One is&hellip; making noise?&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Pens capping and uncapping, backpack zipping and unzipping, new notebooks coming onto the desk and coming off, there&rsquo;s a label maker in the mix&hellip; Girl has a whole assembly line going.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Ok. This is disruptive and everyone knows it. With more time in the principal&rsquo;s office than in class, she knows, too.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: center;">&mdash;</p>
                  <p>She does something amazing: gets up, walks to the back of the class, takes a 100 piece puzzle off a shelf, and sits down to do it COMPLETELY SILENTLY.</p>
                  <p>This is amazing. She ABANDONED the class without disrespecting the teacher or her peers. She needed a break, so she took the break. 15 minutes later, she&rsquo;s back in her seat.</p>
                  <p>Desks have rules. They are metal. They are cramped. They make a loud noise when you get up and a little quiet noise when you sit down.</p>
                  <p>Constrictive physical space hurts your happiness.</p>
                  <p>But getting up during class is scary. Here are three approaches:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li><strong>Get permission from the teacher before class</strong>:</li>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Bring in a puzzle.</li>
                  <li>Keep the ask simple, yes/no. If you see hesitation, offer to let the teacher choose a time during class that would be least disruptive.</li>
                  <li>Continue negotiating: Say this is the only time you&rsquo;ll do it this semester, and that it would be very helpful for your mental health.</li>
                  <li>If the teacher is still hesitant, fall back, finish the puzzle on your own time. The next day, bring in a picture of the completed puzzle with a note like: &ldquo;I finished the puzzle! I measured my heart rate before and after, and it went from [X] to [y] [link to handbook page on heart rate, breathing strategies, humming, all these tactics]. Afterwards, I was able to complete [assignments for the class]. Also, doesn&rsquo;t it look pretty?&rdquo;</li>
                  <li>Try asking again in a week. [add pic]</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li><strong>Take the middle ground</strong></li>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Ask to sit on the floor and take notes, no puzzle. Follow the same type of negotiating steps.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li><strong>Fuck it. Get up really, really, quietly.&nbsp;</strong></li>
                  <ul>
                  <li>You just gotta commit to that one. Pretend nothing&rsquo;s happening</li>
                  </ul>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Either way, <strong>when you become an active negotiator in classroom boundaries, you stop feeling powerless in school</strong>. Take this first (scary) step, then push to bigger opportunities [link].</p>
                  <p>If you don&rsquo;t like puzzles, bring in literally anything else that&rsquo;s quiet, chill, and not distracting.</p>

                  </ul>
                  <li>Negotiate: <strong>leave your phone</strong>. If your teacher knows you&rsquo;re not leaving just to text, they&rsquo;ll be more comfortable with leaving. Your teacher&rsquo;s authority depends on (&ldquo;hinges on&rdquo;) them being reasonable [link to classroom management]: When you are reasonable and offer a compromise, they must respect that to maintain the class&rsquo;s respect.&nbsp;</li>
                  <li>If you go to an underfunded school (a school that doesn&rsquo;t have enough money), you can use that as evidence to back up your argument: &ldquo;I understand that me leaving class is not a perfect solution to my stress and tiredness, but I don&rsquo;t have access to other resources. Our student-counselor ratio [hover text explaining this] is X and&hellip; [personal example, eg. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know the social worker&rsquo;s name&rdquo;].

                  </ul>
                  <li>Are you too anxious to leave? Try building up to it in small steps. Step one, go to the grocery store and buy an avocado. Step two, ask a friendly teacher to use their whiteboard for five minutes after school. Draw a giraffe in the corner and don&rsquo;t erase it. Slowly do more and more scary, but completely fine tasks: full list [link to exposure therapy].</li>
                  <ul>
                  <li>I grew up watching this kid, Nalen, walk out of computer science class two minutes into the block, every day. Most of the class was group work, so he didn&rsquo;t miss much. One day I asked him where he went and he said, nowhere. He wasn&rsquo;t a genius who didn&rsquo;t need to be there: it was his first honors class. Maybe he wanted to stay, but I wanted to leave, just for a few minutes, one day. So I did. I was worried about offending the teacher, but leaving wasn&rsquo;t an attack on her, it was for me and my well-being. I started leaving more often, never like Nalen, but for 10 minutes, then 15, then 10 minutes in other classes, too. I got happier.</li>

                  <h2>Salami Tactics</h2>
                  <p>Salamiing something means making progress on it the way a butcher cuts salami: one tiny slice at a time. Salami Tactics are used by politicians, armies, and anybody trying to establish a new normal. For you, that means taking a one minute water break from class on the first day of school, then a two minute break on the second week, then a three minute break on the second <em>month</em>.</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>SAY WHAT&rsquo;S IN IT FOR THEM:</li>
                  <ul>
                  <li>You are less of a class disruption.</li>
                  <li>They don&rsquo;t have to manage you.</li>
                  <li>Brainstorm: What other reasons might your teacher want a break from you?</li>

                  <p>ALWAYS COMPROMISE: Remember puzzle girl? She used to be way more hostile in classes, other kids hated it, the teacher hated it, and she was unhappy, too. This puzzle set is her compromise, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s yours. You have to find your own middle ground. Maybe your sibling gets away with everything and your parents will yell at you if you blink. You&rsquo;re never going to be as lucky as your sibling, but you can push for a little less strictness. Here&rsquo;s a fun compromise: (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nBBKf56oKcw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nBBKf56oKcw</a>Tom Segura video</p>)
                  <p>You can be the kid with headphones who leaves two minutes into class, or you can be the kid who smiles at the teacher and pops into the back of the cafeteria, daps up the lunch lady, and gets a free burger. [link to school lunch].&nbsp;</p>

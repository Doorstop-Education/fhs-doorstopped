<!-- <p class="subtitle" style="font-family: League Spartan; color: #989aa2; font-size: 15pt;">A step-by-step guide to getting a schoolwide a day off, plus strategies for even bigger schedule change.</p> -->
<p>In most states, teachers have collective bargaining power: meaning they can go on strike when the school undercuts them on salary or working conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new movement in progressive districts (<a href="https://oaklandside.org/2023/05/26/oakland-teachers-strike-common-good-proposals-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oakland</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://mailchi.mp/utla/20230418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2020/02/19/st-paul-teachers-take-strike-vote-thursday-heres-what-theyre-bargaining-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St. Paul</a>, <a href="https://www.ctulocal1.org/posts/ctu-allies-lay-out-common-good-platform-to-protect-students-families-workers-as-coronavirus-threat-spreads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago</a>) where teachers go on strike for &ldquo;common good&rdquo; issues like student homelessness, transportation, and even challenges to a school&rsquo;s organizational structure. School boards argue these issues don&rsquo;t belong in a strike, and should be decided by the community. Teachers clearly disagree. Collective bargaining adds more leverage than pressuring the school board to pass a &ldquo;resolution,&rdquo; a promise to make some change, since the school board can just as easily revoke that resolution. Bargaining leads to a <em>contract</em>, meaning if the school board doesn&rsquo;t follow through, the Union can sue them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There is a power asymmetry here.</strong> When teachers don&rsquo;t go to school, school doesn&rsquo;t happen. But even if the school board agrees to teachers&rsquo; demands, it may literally <em>not have enough money to follow through</em>. If teachers ask for a 3% raise, the school board might be able to make room in the budget. But since teacher salaries increase every year based on a teacher&rsquo;s experience, the school is now committing to pay more, every year, even as special COVID funding a school might&rsquo;ve received runs out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t enough money in education for everyone to get what they want. Good proposals for policy and practice change will not only explain the problem, but also find a budget solution.</p>
<p>Students have more leverage. By showing up to school more, you literally increase your school&rsquo;s budget because state funding is allocated based on a school&rsquo;s average attendance. More importantly, you have something better than a contract: when teachers go on strike, everyone suffers&mdash;teachers don&rsquo;t get paid, parents need to figure out where to send their kids during the day, the school board looks awful&mdash;but when students protest, they are not taking an inherently hostile attitude towards any group except the one they target.</p>
<p>In fact&hellip; you can get support from other groups by <a href="/school/allies">making powerful allies</a>.</p>

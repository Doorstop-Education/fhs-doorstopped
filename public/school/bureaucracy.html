<!-- Kennesaw State University professor Benjamin Scafidi documents the 
    public-education-staffing surge from 1950 to 2015, when the number of 
    teachers grew more than twice as fast as student enrollments did, and 
    the ranks of administrators and support staff rose nearly three times 
    as fast as teachers did. From 1950 to 2006 the number of students for 
    each school staffer fell from 19.3 to eight. With ever larger staffs, 
    education budgets soared, but teacher pay stagnated, encouraging teachers 
    to make more money by leaving the classroom. For men, athletic coaching 
    offered a direct path into high-paying administrative jobs above the 
    unglamorous work of classroom teaching. For women, new education bureaucratic 
    professions such as “curriculum specialist” offered similar upward mobility.

Second, bureaucratization means that principals have little control
 over the other professionals working inside their buildings. In Smarter 
 Budgets, Smarter Schools, former school superintendent Nate Levenson grouses 
 that when coordinators of specialized programs within schools claim that federal 
 or state statutes require a particular practice or expenditure, few know enough to 
 argue back. With dozens or even hundreds of spending categories, it is rare that a 
 principal understands their school budget, much less how to shift resources from 
 what fails to what works.

The hard reality of asking for more social workers/student supports is it requires firing
 useless (but human) people in the district office. The really hard reality is those people
  heavily influence the budget.-->

    in the 1970s, the critique came from the left. From that perspective, the bureaucracy 
    was a top-down system in which those at the top (policy makers, administrators) impose 
    their will on the actors at the bottom (teachers, students, parents, and communities). 
    Because the bureaucracy was built within a system that perpetuated inequalities of class, 
    race, and gender, it tended to operate in a way that made sure that White males from the 
    upper classes maintained their position, and that stifled grassroots efforts to bring about 
    change from below. Central critical texts at the time were Class, Bureaucracy, and Schools, 
    published in 1971 by Michael Katz and Schooling in Capitalist America, published in 1976 
    by Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis.

    By the 1990s, however, attacks on school bureaucracy started to come from the right. Building on 
    the Reagan-era view of government as the problem rather than the solution, critics in the emergent 
    school choice movement began to develop a critique of bureaucracy as a barrier to school effectiveness. 
    The central text then was Politics, Markets, and America’s Schools by John Chubb and Terry Moe (1990), 
    who argued that organizational autonomy was the key factor that made private and religious schools more 
    effective than public schools. Because they didn’t have to follow the rigid rules laid down by the school 
    district bureaucracy, they were free to adapt to families’ demands for the kind of schools that met their 
    children’s needs. To Chubb and Moe, state control of schools inevitably stifles the imagination and will 
    of local educators.

  <!-- IS THERE NO ACADEMIC RESEARCH ON CORRELATION BETWEEN STIFLING BUREAUCRACY AND STUDENT SUCCESS? WHERE?? -->

  <!-- SCHOOLS BREAK LAWS ALL THE TIME

I have poked around the Code of Alabama and the Administrative Code from time to time when researching particular subjects, and recently I came upon Section 16-6B-7 of the Code of Alabama, which mandates “Accountability Reports to the Public“.  It not only reminded me why I wanted to write this, but provides a perfect first example.          

Act 1995-313, the source of the section below, was passed in 1995 with much fanfare about how it would improve accountability and parental involvement and how our school community would be much better informed about what types of progress our schools were making.  Important parts of it appear to have been ignored.

Required Student Achievement Reporting

Here’s what the law said specifically about what reports each local board was required to produce to share with their public, taken from the Code of Alabama:

———————————————————————————————–
Section 16-6B-7
Accountability reports to the public.
(a) The local board of education shall prepare an annual accountability report for each school and area vocational/technical center under its jurisdiction, and for itself, to be provided to the public under regulations promulgated by the State Board of Education. Such accountability reports shall include, but not be limited to, all of the following:

(1) A Funding and Expenditure Report which shall include those documents specified in Section 16-6B-4 and which shall include the amount of Foundation Program funds or vocational/technical education funds, or both, earned and of all funds expended and any other data deemed necessary by the local board of education or the State Board of Education to inform the public about the financial status of each school.

(2) A Student Achievement Report which shall include a comparison of the immediately previous school year with the previous five years regarding student performance on testing required by the State Board of Education, dropout rates, attendance rates, graduation rates, college attendance, and any other data deemed necessary by the local board of education or the State Board of Education to inform the public about student achievement in each school.

(3) A School Safety and Discipline Report which shall include statistical information relating to student safety and discipline in each school and any other data deemed necessary by the local board of education or the State Board of Education to inform the public about safety and discipline in each school. [We know this as the Student Incident Report, or SIR]

(b) These reports shall be released to the media, presented to parent organizations, members of the Legislature who represent the schools covered in each report, and the State Superintendent of Education. These reports shall be made available to the public upon request on or before ninety (90) days after the end of the fiscal year.
(Acts 1995, No. 95-313, p. 620, §7.)
——————————————————————————————— 

Let’s focus on the Student Achievement Report under (2) above.  This law requires each and every local board of education to produce a report comparing the most recently past school year with the previous five years including:

student performance on testing required by the State Board of Education,
dropout rates,
attendance rates,
graduation rates,
college attendance, and
any other data deemed necessary by the local board of education or the State Board of Education to inform the public about student achievement in each school.
I have never seen one of these reports produced by a local board of education.

SOOOOOOO NOBODY DOES IT

THE ONLY PUNISHMENT A SUPERIOR CAN HIT AN INFERIOR WITH IS TAKING AWAY FUNDING, WHICH ONLY HURTS. THERE IS NO CARROT?

Teachers spend hours every week filling out forms that no one ever reads -- because the laws and regulations that have piled up over the years require them. 
!! is this true -Teachers are instructed never -- never ever -- to put an arm around a crying child: the school might get sued.

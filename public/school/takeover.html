<h1 style="line-height: 1.5em;">State takeover <img style="display: inline" width="24px" height="24px" src="/assets/images/thunder.png"> How the upper echelons of education operate</h1>

<img src="/assets/images/school/takeover.webp" loading="eager"  fetchpriority="high" width="400" style="max-inline-size: 100%; width: 98%; margin: auto;">
<p>State takeovers are like a Christmas present you didn&rsquo;t really want&hellip; but you have to smile about it.</p>
<p>When a school district is failing (50% graduation rate, awful test scores, low attendance, way too many suspensions, minorities + special ed students performing worse), the state can &ldquo;take over&rdquo; the district, gaining the combined authority of the school board and the superintendent.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> It&rsquo;s a power play above your paygrade, but understanding it is important because <strong>millions of dollars go into funding these changes and students rarely see a nickel.</strong><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">1</a></sup> Plus, student outcomes rarely improve, <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/05/15/metro/school-takeovers-by-state-havent-worked-globe-analysis-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even in Massachusetts</a>, a state that consistently ranks #1 on national surveys.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<ol class=reformat>
<li >Low income groups don&rsquo;t get to voice their opinion on how the takeover should work, even though they&rsquo;re the most affected group. Part of the obstacle is just traveling from your town all the way to the state capital to voice your opinion at takeover discussions.</li>
<li>Takeover usually means limiting the central office and empowering principals. Do you hear the word, &ldquo;Students&rdquo;? Me neither. That can be an important policy improvement, but it is so far away from day-to-day school experience.</li>
<li>The state is great at managing money, so schools get more financially efficient, but student outcomes don&rsquo;t improve because&hellip; what does the state know about managing schools?&nbsp;</li>
<li>The state usually recognizes it has to build trust with the community (parents and teachers), but don&rsquo;t realize <strong>building trust is only the first step to changing culture</strong>.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></li>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 12pt"><span style="color: #666666;">See <em>State Takeover</em> by Simone Fried, which is also the source of the following example about a hispanic mother.</span></p>
<p>At Doorstop Education, we believe that <strong>listening to and building trust with marginalized groups is not enough</strong>. If you help a Spanish-speaking mom understand how the school is supporting her son with ADHD, translating documents into Spanish for her, that&rsquo;s great. But can you really say this woman has a voice in the shape of her son&rsquo;s educational experience? No!</p>
<p>Marginalized communities need to be educated on how school works to reasonably voice a perspective on policy with resources like this one. A successful school reform study in the 1980s <em>paid parents a small salary</em> to attend informational meetings on how school was run and how they can best support their students.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> The results were incredible.</p>
<p>The same has to be done for students. &ldquo;Focus groups&rdquo; and &ldquo;principal&rsquo;s breakfasts&rdquo; usually bring the most motivated kids to the conversation. Seeking out the students that don&rsquo;t show up&hellip; or care&hellip; <em>is</em> incredibly difficult, but it is also necessary. How can you help those students if they don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s going on?&mdash;or that there&rsquo;s something <em>that could be changed</em>.</p>
<p>So&hellip; how do you go about that? Has this type of thing been done anywhere since the 1980s?</p>
<p>... No. But we're giving it a go! Sign up for <a href="https://doorstopfellows.org">Doorstop Fellas</a> to get our help running these types of programs at your school!</p>

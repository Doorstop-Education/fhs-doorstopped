<!-- <p class="subtitle" style="font-family: League Spartan; color: #989aa2; font-size: 15pt;">A step-by-step guide to getting a schoolwide a day off, plus strategies for even bigger schedule change.</p> -->
<p>Schools make decisions. You find out weeks or months later. When you do know in advance, there's not much they can do without <strong>allies</strong>, who'll help you find out about decisions in advance, too.</p>
<p>Understanding what adults ~really mean~ when they make claims at school board meetings and in announcements is a critical skill. It&rsquo;ll be valuable way beyond school when you&rsquo;ll be navigating similar politics in your workplace. Here&rsquo;s a few examples.</p>
<p>In June 2023, the state of Texas began a &ldquo;takeover&rdquo; of the Houston School District (HISD), which has been underperforming for a long time. The State threatened a takeover for many years before following through and implementing sweeping changes, including a complete restructuring of 28 of the district&rsquo;s schools. Here&rsquo;s state-appointed Acting Superintendent, Mike Miles:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we can do is do what hospitals do for their doctors. Doctors don&rsquo;t prep the room, they don&rsquo;t prep the materials, they don&rsquo;t take the blood pressure or heart rate. They just come in, have somebody else put their gloves on for them and then they do their thing. That&rsquo;s their skill. That&rsquo;s why they get paid what they get paid. We want you to do that."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is Miles saying&hellip; [select all that apply]</p>
<ul>
<li>Teachers will not be micromanaged. [Y/N]</li>
<li>Teachers will get to choose curriculum. [N]</li>
<li>Teachers will not have to do simple tasks (eg. making copies) [Y]</li>
</ul>
<p>If you were a teacher, would you want to work at a school like this? What would you be suspicious of?&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Who is going to do all this, and will I have an assistant? Where will the money come from, and is giving teachers assistants sustainable? Does this mean I won&rsquo;t have flexibility in what and how I teach? Will I be given a script on what to say?</em></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the Houston Mayor has to say about the takeover&mdash;keep in mind, Texas mayors are not involved in their city&rsquo;s schools.</p>
<p>"The State takeover of HISD is not about one school or 30 schools. This is a concerted attempt to take over public education in the largest district and those who run it while intentionally side stepping some schools which they dare not touch. This is a long term occupation."</p>
<p>Based on the Mayor&rsquo;s word choice (&ldquo;take over public education,&rdquo; &ldquo;long term occupation&rdquo;) is he for or against the state&rsquo;s decision?</p>
<ul>
<li>For it.</li>
<li>Against it.</li>
</ul>
<p>When he says &ldquo;intentionally side stepping some schools which they dare not touch,&rdquo; what is the mayor implying?</p>
<p>&mdash;-</p>
<p>From Alameda County&rsquo;s superintendent after teacher&rsquo;s unions and the Oakland School board, one of many in the county, reached a new agreement, with teachers getting significant raises in what was the lowest-earning district in the county:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alameda County Office of Education appreciates the hard work ahead as the district board and staff demonstrate their commitment to ensuring the district can afford the impact of this settlement while providing a robust and sustainable education program for its students,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which of the following do you think she said next:</p>
<ul>
<li>"We recognize the importance of investing in our teachers and ensuring they are fairly compensated for their dedication to our students. This agreement reflects our commitment to attracting and retaining high-quality educators who play a vital role in shaping the future of our district."</li>
<li>"We understand the financial implications of this settlement and the need to carefully manage our resources to maintain a balanced budget. Our office will work closely with the district board and staff to develop a comprehensive financial plan that supports the long-term sustainability of our education program."</li>
<li>&ldquo;Without further board action and successful implementation of budget-balancing solutions, OUSD is projected to be insolvent within three years.&rdquo; [Y]</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Taking steps&rdquo; content /d/takingsteps</li>
<li>Looking up your school&rsquo;s quality report/state standards/ESSA standards. Look at where things are short, those are your incentives.</li>
<li>Looking up last time your school had a zero tolerance discipline policy</li>
<li>How do you audit a district? Understand the decision-makers? Make sense of the budget?</li>
</ul>

<p>Every month, post in your city facebook group a short update on what's happening in the school. You'll have 100s of parents reading your posts and curious about what you think. When you need community support for policy change, they'll have your back. Example:</p>
<div class="copy-paste-element">
    <div>
      <p>Hey everyone! I'm a student at [high school name] and want to update you on what's changed at school this month.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>We won our first basketball game of the season thanks to Jason Derulo's 25 points and 6/8 shooting from three!</p>
    </li>
        <li>
        <p>Freshman English is reading a Hamlet and a lot of students are... confused. They don't know how to get through the class without SparkNotes. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The agenda for the next school board meeting has a note about changing English curriculum for next year - <strong>could mean spending a lot of money on textbooks</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>We've been having a lot of subs in math class because of the statewide teacher shortage, but some awesome people from the AP class are stepping up to tutor during free periods</p>
    </li>

  <h2><img  style="display: inline" width="24px" height="24px" src="/assets/images/spazz.png"> Help an involved teacher</h2>
<p>There’s a teacher at every school trying to do cool stuff. It might not impact you directly—they could be fighting for funding to help special needs students, or pushing other teachers to talk slower so ESL kids can keep up—but they are a valuable ally. Unlike most people who work in schools (who care, but not enough to stick their neck out), this person will fight for you. First, help them achieve what they’re working on, then they’ll be more than ready to help you.
</p>
    <p>Ask a teacher you’re close with who these people are at your school.

      <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Free to talk about how the central office can improve student outcomes?<br><br>
Hi [Staffer's Name],<br><br>
I've been anxious about sending this email: I've always felt a little trapped at my desk as a student, like my voice doesn't matter. I want to start speaking up, so thank you for reading. 
<br><br>
When a new policy/budget/hiring decision makes its way down from the district office, students don't hear about it until the decision is set in stone. This is important! You can't make every decision by committee.
<br><br>
Not involving students <em>can</em> lead to decisions that really do hurt us, which in turn impacts attendance, discipline issues, and teacher wellbeing. For example, [give a simple example, eg. "you hired more teachers for non-academic subjects (awesome!) but the classes had low enrollment - asking students which subjects they wanted first could've helped"].
<br><br>
Would you be open to sharing monthly updates when there's a decision being made that might impact students? If there's anything I can do to support your work as well, I'd be more than happy to :)
<br><br>
With hope and gratitude,<br>
[Your name]

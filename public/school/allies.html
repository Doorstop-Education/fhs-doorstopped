<p>Schools make decisions. You find out weeks or months later. When you do know in advance, there's not much they can do without <strong>allies</strong>, who, by the way, will help you find out about change in advance, too.</p>

<h2>Help an involved teacher</h2>
<p>There’s a teacher at every school trying to do cool stuff. It might not impact you directly—they could be fighting for funding to help special needs students, or pushing other teachers to talk slower so ESL kids can keep up—but they are a valuable ally. Unlike most people who work in schools (who care, but not enough to stick their neck out), this person will fight for you. First, help them achieve what they’re working on, then they’ll be more than ready to help you.
</p>
    <p>Ask a teacher you’re close with who these people are at your school. 
    </p>
<h2>Parents are OP</h2>
<p>Every month, post in your city facebook group a short update on what's happening in the school. You'll have 100s of parents reading your posts and curious about what you think. When you need community support for policy change, they'll have your back. Example:</p>
<div class="copy-paste-element">
    <div>
      <p>Hey everyone! I'm a student at [high school name] and want to update you on what's changed at school this month.<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>

    </li>
</ul>
<br><br>Thanks so much for reading!

<h2>The librarian is every school's secret weapon</h2>
<p>The library is <em>always</em> a place you can go when you're stressed, tired, or angry in a class. And making small talk with the librarian is different than building relationships with teachers because <strong>the librarian doesn't grade you</strong>. You can build real friendships and get real support.</p>
<p>Start the conversation with:</p>

  <p>Have a question about how your school works? The librarian will answer.</p>
<h2>The custodian can get anything done</h2>
<p>If you EVER need something fixed and admin won’t fund it (e.g. gross bathrooms), custodians will have your back and not say anything when a plumber comes to make basic repairs.
</p>
<p>Say thank you to them once in a while. They deserve it. Apologize for the school being a mess, even if it's not your fault.</p>

  <h2>Make a friend in the district office</h2>
<p>The district office is uniquely permanent. Unlike the superintendent, principal, or school board, they are not "elected." But they make a huge number of student-facing decisions without you knowing.</p>
<p>The can be your <em>early warning system</em>, helping you stop bad policy before it happens, from <a href="/school/newhire">hiring the wrong principal</a> to fixing awful policy.</p>
<p>Find the right staff by googling:</p>

  <p>Don't reach out to the head of the department right away. Start with a "deputy director." If you're interested in hiring, , if you're interested in fixing the school building, try the facilities director. </p>
  <h3>Typical Titles for What You want to change</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Boring classes: "Teaching & Learning" Department</li>
    <li>Janky building: "Facilities" or "Grounds"</li>
    <li>Food or buses: "Student Services"</li>
    <li>Budget: "Finance and Operations" or just "Operations"</li>
    <li>Hiring: An administrative assistant (secretary) might be best</li>

      <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Free to talk about how the central office can improve student outcomes?<br><br>
Hi [Staffer's Name],<br><br>
I've been anxious about sending this email: I've always felt a little trapped at my desk as a student, like my voice doesn't matter. I want to start speaking up, so thank you for reading. 
<br><br>
When a new policy/budget/hiring decision makes its way down from the district office, students don't hear about it until the decision is set in stone. This is important! You can't make every decision by committee.
<br><br>
Not involving students <em>can</em> lead to decisions that really do hurt us, which in turn impacts attendance, discipline issues, and teacher wellbeing. For example, [give a simple example, eg. "you hired more teachers for non-academic subjects (awesome!) but the classes had low enrollment - asking students which subjects they wanted first could've helped"].
<br><br>
Would you be open to sharing monthly updates when there's a decision being made that might impact students? If there's anything I can do to support your work as well, I'd be more than happy to :)
<br><br>
With hope and gratitude,<br>
[Your name]

<h2>Find out who <em>really</em> runs the school</h2>

<p>If there&rsquo;s a holiday you want off, all it takes is a well-placed email. We helped Max Z., who goes to a public school in Massachussets, get a scheduled day off to celebrate the Lunar New Year. Here's how:</p>
<p>Max leveraged a key reality about schedules: <strong>while you need to have 180 days in the school year, there are dozens of &ldquo;FLEXIBLE&rdquo; days when teachers have &ldquo;professional development,&rdquo;</strong> mandatory training that can take a whole school day.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the email he sent to his principal.</p>

            <p>Other online guides will tell you to ask your teachers and neighbors for anyone they know that would hire you, or google "intership for high schoolers [your city name]."</p>
            <p>This isn't a bad place to start, but there's an easy email you can send to a company that'll get you an internship ASAP.</p>

            <h2>1. Choose a company near you, or find one you like online</h2>
            <p>If you're not sure where to look, try the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies">Y Combinator list of companies</a>. Y Combinator is the place where innovative new companies go to raise money, so there are a lot of awesome places to work listed there. A lot of these companies would <strong>take high school interns</strong> because they're new companies: they just need smart people who are happy to help, they don't care if you have a college degree.</p>
            <p>Let's go through an example from Y Combinator:</p>
            <img src="/assets/images/company search.png" width="100%" style="width: 98%; margin: auto;">
            <p class="subtitle" style="margin: 0; color: #989aa2; text-align: center; font-size: 13pt;">You can filter by industry if you know what kind of work you want to do.</p>
            <p>Choose a company that sounds cool, maybe we'll check out Slash. Go to their website, Google around...</p>
            <img src="/assets/images/linkedinslash.png" width="100%" style="width: 98%; margin: auto;">
            <p class="subtitle" style="margin: 0; color: #989aa2; text-align: center; font-size: 13pt;">The founders are only 20 or 21, and their business seems to be about helping young people. They won't have a problem with you only being in high school!</p>
            <h2>2. Find <strong style="color: hsl(351, 83%, 61%)">three things</strong> you'd improve about their company</h2>
            <p>This is going to be how you impress them when you reach out asking for a job.</p>
            <p><strong>Try out their product:</strong> what was annoying/boring/a missed opportunity? What features should they add?</p>
            <p><strong>Think about how they make money:</strong> what else could they do to make <em>more</em> money? Are there other types of customers they could sell to, or a similar product they could add on to theirs? Are there cooler ways they could run marketing?</p>
            <p>Give suggestions on <em>what you're interested</em>. If you want to do design, critique their website. If you want to do marketing, roast their IG. If you want to help them sell luxury helicopters to Middle Eastern billionaires, say so.</p>
            <p>Check out Slash online and see what you would improve on, then compare notes with us! We noticed they...</p>
            <p><strong>1.</strong> don't have a YouTube channel (weird, they're selling to young entrepreneurs and there's so many of them using YT!)</p>
            <p><strong>2.</strong> have SO many features, it's not really clear how to get started - maybe a video explainer on their site or in their onboarding could help</p>
            <p><strong>3.</strong> have very few blog posts, meaning nobody is going to find their page from Google search, a huge missed opportunity</p>

            <h2>3. Send them an email asking for an internship!</h2>

Hey [name],
<br><br>I'm a [#]th grader that loves your mission for [product name//restate their mission statement//quickly explain why the company is cool to you.]
                    
<br><br>I tried out your product and noticed a couple opportunities I could work on over [the summer//winter break//whenever you want to work].
<br><br>- [opportunity #1 + how YOUR skillset/experience can help]
<br>- [opportunity #2 + how YOUR skillset/experience can help]
<br>- [opportunity #3 + how YOUR skillset/experience can help]

<br><br>[optional: "I come from an under-resourced high school where I don’t have opportunities to pursue work outside the classroom, so the opportunity to work with and learn from you would be invaluable."]"
          
<br><br>Are you free to talk about how I could contribute? I'm free [narrow time windows eg. Mondays and Tuesdays after 3pm] and [wide time window, eg anytime Fridays].

<br><br>With hope and gratitude,<br>

Hey [name],
<br><br>I'm a 11th grader that's gassed about your mission and I love the way you talk about hustle.
                    
<br><br>I tried out Slash and noticed a couple opportunities I could work on over this summer:
<br><br>- You guys could have a huge presence on YouTube: I've been making videos for my school's journalism club for years w/ 50,000 views.
<br>- You've built TOO MANY awesome features, and as a first-time user it was hard to know what was what. I can create explainer videos for your landing page and onboarding.
<br>- Money is super confusing for young entrepreneurs, and I could help you build interactive blog posts that make sure you win at SEO
          
<br><br>Are you free to talk about how I could contribute? I'm free Mondays and Tuesdays after 3pm and any time Fridays.

      <p><strong>Read something online </strong> could be academic research from <a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a>, a news article, or a thread or blog post you found on <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. Think of a question for the author, and reach out asking to talk!</p>
      <p>Doesn't have to be someone your mom would love you working for. It could be a video editor who works for a YouTuber you follow or a local Zookeeper.</p>

                          <p>Dear [Mr./Ms. ____]<br><br>
I'm a(n) [#]th grader at [high school name] with a summer internship at [company name].<br><br>

This internship would be a life-changing experience, but because it's unpaid, I may not be able to accept the offer.

I come from an under-resourced high school where I don’t have opportunities to explore [topic] outside the classroom, but I believe [topic] could be a deep, sustaining vocation. Without work experience in the field, I don't know that I'd be able to get a job like that when I graduate.<br><br>

Would you be able to support funding my living expenses for the summer through a donation of $500, $1,000, or $1,500?

Thank you so much for your consideration.<br><br>

With hope and gratitude,<br>
[Your Name]
                          </p>

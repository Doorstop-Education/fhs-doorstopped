<h1>Start with urinal dividers</h1>

<p>It can be done:</p>
<p>These students at Saratoga High School, a public school in California, wrote an <a href="https://saratogafalcon.org/content/urinal-dividers-we-want-more/">op-ed in the school newspaper</a>. They called the article "Urinal dividers: We want more."</p>
<p>They negotiated with administrators. They sent constant emails. The administrators <a href="https://saratogafalcon.org/content/dividers-boys-bathrooms-greeted-positively/">added urinal dividers</a>.</p>
<p>The first thing you should try is asking.</p>

we should buy one of those videos celebrities do and get them to do one about cleaning up after you poo and getting gross bathrooms fixed
maybe a rapper

training students to assess restrooms, write work orders for
repairs, design and oversee major renovations

I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT: "In another case, Project CLEAN wrote a `user standard’ for schools based on the
belief that students should be seen more as citizens and not have restroom regulations
based so often on the disruptive action of a few"


"The leading school building administrator must be behind restroom improvement
to initiate such an effort, yet paradoxically he or she must engender a team of students,
other administrators, a few teachers and custodian and even parents, plus get district
support for a project to work"

"Too often when there is a problem,
for example with cigarette smoking in a high school, the chief administrator “solves” that
issue by locking the restroom doors, thus creating a host of other issues." - tell the Aaron story

" All too often disgruntled custodians leave graffiti
up for days, even weeks."


"Most regular subject teachers not
only refuse to monitor, let alone use school restrooms, but they also do not try to connect
their subject with restroom issues and etiquette."

MAKE TEACHERS USE STUDENT RESTROOMS FOR A DAY

Boards of education often hold meetings at schools and they may see the
principal’s restroom, or the newly cleaned ones in the front hall near the meeting space.
These officials go too infrequently to the locker room or the back hall bathroom and see
doorless stalls, paperless dispensers, and graffiti on the walls

TAKE THE BOARD TO THE RESTROOM OR BRING PICTURES.

email school board members (how to find their email) - first ask an ally (librarian, involved parent)
who's who and who will be receptive

Hi [Admin's Name],<br><br>

Could you consider [installing new toilets / fixing holes in the bathroom walls / adding urinal dividers - whatever you want fixed] this year? Bathrooms are a basic need, and the need is not being met for all students here.<br><br>

Are you free to meet and talk about how this could fit into our budget? I'm free [List some times that work for you - or cc the principal's secretary on the email instead].<br><br>

[Optional: <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/districtsearch/">look up school finance data</a> and say, eg. "I looked at our spending last year and saw that we spent >$100k on textbooks last year, even though all students only use the digital versions of the books. Lets discuss this and other opportunities to cut costs."]

[I/my child/my friends] don't feel comfortable using the bathrooms in school because they are [describe problem]. I'm sure there is room in the budget for repairs: [my/my child's/my friends'] physical wellbeing should be high on the school's priority list.

<h2>If admin says eh, here's what you say back:</h2>
<p><strong>If admin doesn't think it's important:</strong> Collect data. IG poll your followers a simple question: "Do you poop in school?" High numbers are your evidence. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/07435584221139342">Cite studies</a> that show the negative health effects of gross bathrooms.</p>
<p><strong>If admin says they don't have the money:</strong> go directly to the source, plumbers.</p>
<p>Email local plumbers asking for them to come fix up the bathroom for free in exchange for...</p>
<ul class="badonk">
  <li class="honk">Flyers sent home with every student advertising their service.</li>
  <li class="honk">Banners advertising them at sports events.</li>
</ul>
<p>This agreement <em>has</em> to be informal because the school can't approve that type of quid pro quo. Meaning you'll have to get those flyers into everyones' backpacks yourself. It will also help to <em>make friends with your custodians,</em> because at the end of the day they're the only people who have to be involved. Admin has their own bathrooms, they'll honestly never know if someone came in and repaired the student ones. Custodians have seen the bathrooms you have to use and will (hopefully) support you, as long as you're not asking the plumber to tear up the whole floor.</p>
<p><strong>If admin think students are the problem</strong>, and that people are always going to graffiti/smoke/start fires in the bathroom, ask them if they've ever seen drug deals happen in the Ralph Lauren store bathrooms.</p>
<p>Wait. Don't use those words. </p>
<p>Express that people don't respect the space right now because the space doesn't respect them. Nice bathrooms will change how students act in them. For evidence, ask them if they've ever been at a school that upgraded or renovated to a new building - did the graffiti and vandalism stop? Their answer will <em>probably</em> be yes - it's definitely what we've heard from teachers!</p>
<!-- In rural Sicily, students walk out of school in protest when bathroom conditions get as bad as they do here. A story from Cathy Li (link to her bio), who spent a summer teaching there.-->

  <!-- <p>Men: protest by lining up on the football field and pretending to all take a leak. Have someone take it from behind all of you. Put it on your instagram stories. Share it with a journalist.</p>-->

<!-- email templates -->
<!-- "but people smoke and fuck in the bathrooms" - they don't respect the space bc the space doesn't respect them. When a district upgrades to a new school building, the graffiti/vandalism problems of the old, dilapidated school stop. Fast. -->
<!-- outreach to local plumbing companies asking them to just come do it for free as a public service, we'll send ads home to every parent / we'll put up a big banner at football games -->

<!-- Four senses inspection -->

<!-- student clubs adopt a restroom, janitors help develop forms to track vandalism
show up to school board meetings in rubber yellow gloves
form committees urging people to flush and clean up after themselves

The future of your community and of you yourself could be influenced by how well you aim and flush today.-->
